# Key Assumptions for multiple linear regression:
# 1. Linear relationship between input and output variable(s).
#
# 2. There is not a strong linear assocation between the input variables
# 
# 3. The value noise is normally distributed
#
# 4. The variance within all of the populations is equal
#
# We check these assumptions in practice as follows:
# linear relation (residual plot), nomrality (QQ plot, Shpiro-Wilk), variance (Barlett test) after model fitting
# collinearity before model fitting
